         * whose title flew in, but a fade *out* is not how iOS leaves one, and it was applied to the
         * gesture as well, so the page never tracked the finger. See `NavDisplay`'s `contentTransform`,
         * where each spec falls back on its own — naming the open one does not drag the others with it.
